# Recursion
Code used for recursive problems.
1)TheSmartieMultiplierProblem ---- this problem basically says that two boys eat a number of candies each with a number between 1 and 100 each time they
eat a candy they multiply the number with the number on each smartie they eat e.g 5*4*8 for example , the person with the largest number at the end wins.However 
they can cheat with the multiplication therefore this code checks if the numbers they input of possible or impossible i.e to be impossible if both numbers require 
the same number to be multiplied to be true therefore they are impossible and you output the smallest number(as they are deemed to have cheated less).If the first given 
in number is larger than the second given in number then this is automatically impossible and the smaller number is printed out.Also if a person gives a prime number 
which is over 100 then this is impossible as a prime can only be divided by 1 and itself and therefore is impossible if the numbers on the candies are
between 1 and 100. If they are both possible it prints out the the largest of the two numbers.I used recursion to solve this but it can also be done without it.
2)count 8 will count the number of 8s in a given long.
3)count char will count the amount of unique occurances of a char in a string.
4)solution will calculate a matmatical function using recursion.
